        <p>
          This webinar series is presented jointly by the FIA, FIA Foundation,
          DCU and the UAOA Coalition Members. The aim of this series is to bring
          together scholars and sport industry stakeholders from across the
          globe to disseminate research, share experiences and develop
          collaborative projects on the subject of online abuse. Online abuse is
          a significant problem in sport, as signified by its increased media
          coverage, growing academic support and the development of initiatives
          such as the UAOA Coalition. We hope you enjoy this upcoming webinar as
          we unite to tackle online abuse in sport.
